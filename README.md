# Scheduling Algorithms Gantt Chart

This project is implemented using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It utilizes the Bootstrap and Chart.js libraries to create a Gantt Chart representation of scheduling algorithms. The two algorithms implemented in this project are Rate Monotonic (RM) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF).

## Features

- Gantt Chart visualization: The project provides an interactive Gantt Chart that visualizes the scheduling of tasks based on the selected algorithm.
- Rate Monotonic (RM) Algorithm: The RM algorithm assigns fixed priority levels to tasks based on their periods. The Gantt Chart demonstrates how the tasks are scheduled using this algorithm.
- Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Algorithm: The EDF algorithm assigns priorities to tasks based on their deadlines. The Gantt Chart illustrates how the tasks are scheduled using this algorithm.

## Libraries Used

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): A popular CSS framework that helps create responsive and visually appealing web pages.
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/): A JavaScript library for creating interactive and customizable charts.
